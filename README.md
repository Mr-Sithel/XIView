======

--== Version ==--
I'd like to keep this called XI View, because most everyone from the windower community knows it as that.With that, I will start
it as XI View 2.0

--== DESCRIPTION ==--
XI View 2.0 is the continued work on the project to update FFXIs GUI to look cleaner and for status icons to be easier to understand at a glance, 
this was formerly known as Brandson's UI,FFXI Style or XI View from Darkshade.

XI View 2.0 includes updated Status Icons, Fonts, Graphic User Interface and Menu Skins for wide screen 16:9/16:10 displays. (This still works with
4:3 monitors it's just the pearl/bazzar icons next to you name will be smaller.

Special thanks goes to Darkshade for the original XI View and what he's done over the last year. Kactuar, for fixing the Icon changer program to accept the new 32x32 Icons.
And Deathbringer for the ability to change the ingame fonts and cursors.


Also, thanks Shinobi and Chef James with your help and creating new custom icons! Much appreciated !
