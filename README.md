# XIView 2.0
I'd like to keep this called XI View, because most everyone from the windower community knows it as that.With that, I will start it as XI View 2.0 and have the title screen with the current date that it was updated. 

## Description
XI View 2.0 is the continued work on the project to update FFXIs GUI to look cleaner and for status icons to be easier to understand at a glance, this was formerly known as Brandson's UI,FFXI Style or XI View from Darkshade.

### Private Servers
This is XIVIEW from the Horizon XI private server

## Changes
I know longer play retail and have since played on the Horizon XI server
If you are looking for an up to date retail version of XIVIEW check Caradog

## Fixes
Changed Bard's Ballad and Peon icons. I've wanted to do this for years because it looked to similar to other song colors.

#### Credit
Special thanks goes to Darkshade for the original XI View and what he's done over the last year. Kactuar, for fixing the Icon changer program to accept the new 32x32 Icons. And Deathbringer for the ability to change the ingame fonts and cursors.

Also, thanks Shinobi and Chef James with your help and creating new custom icons! Much appreciated!

#### About Me
I was formally Wildman in the FFXI community 20 years ago and took over this project in 2013 ish when many people moved on. I then recreated many of the status icons and rereleased it as XIVIEW 2.0. Then in some time is 2015 I quit playing and Caradog took over the project.
